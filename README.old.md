# react-project-starter

1. Using the terminal, create the scaffolding for a new React application with the [`create-react-app .`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) generator. You **must** make your app in the _root_ folder of the assignment repo (**not** inside an additional "app" folder):

    ```bash
    # create a react app in _this_ repo
    create-react-app .  # note the period!
    ```

2. I recommend you then "clean up" the `src/` repository, removing the `App.css` and `logo.svg` files and all the content of `App.js`. You can then begin implementing your project fresh with a new `<App>` component.

3. Update the README file to explain what the project is about. You will also track how you both contributed to this stage here.

4. Create a stage-2-yourname folder *in the assignment repo*, and copy in your code so you can have that code for reference!

5. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

6. Let your partner know it's ready!

#### Your partner shall now do the following:

7. Your partner should join the repo by click on the assignment link and then joining the team created earlier.

8. Your partner should then `clone` the repository so they have a copy on their own machine (and `git pull` if needed).

9. Your partner should similar create a folder _in the repo_ called `stage-2-theirname` that contains their stage-2 code, again to be used as reference.

10. Your partner should `push` this code back to GitHub, which you should `pull` down. 

#### Now you are both ready to go!
